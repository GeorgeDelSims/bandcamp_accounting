The objective of this project is to create a program in which you can input a csv downloaded from bandcamp and one from paypal in order to keep a clean accounting system for a small independant record label. The point is to make sure that all artists are paid correctly and to be aware of the exact amounts that actually go into the label's accounts, taking transaction fees and currency conversion into account.
